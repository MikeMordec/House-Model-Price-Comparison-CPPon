# House-Model-Price-Comparison-CPPon

This repository contains a C++ program that compares the price per square foot of three different house models: colonial, split entry, and single story. 
## Description

The program prompts the user to enter the price and finished area (in square feet) of each house model. It then calculates the price per square foot for each model and determines which model has the lowest price per square foot, or if there are ties.

## Features

- Allows user input for the price and finished area of each house model.
- Calculates the price per square foot for each model.
- Determines which model has the lowest price per square foot.
- Handles ties between models appropriately.

## Usage

To use this program:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the price and finished area of each house model.
